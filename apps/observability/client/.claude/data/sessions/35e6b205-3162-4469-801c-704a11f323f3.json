Walking Animation (animalModels.ts)\n- Added `walkMotion(delta)` method to AnimalModel class\n- Implemented alternating leg movement using sinusoidal functions\n- Added body bobbing motion (0.08 units) synchronized with footsteps\n- Implemented arm swinging opposite to leg movement\n- Added forward-leaning posture (0.1 radians) and slight side-to-side sway\n- Head stays relatively level with slight downward tilt to look forward\n\n### 2. Spawn & Walk System (GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue)\n- **Spawn Points**: Characters now spawn either at center (0, 0.3, 0) or random edge positions (radius 12)\n- **State Machine**: Added 5 states to agent tracking:\n  - `spawning` \u2192 character appears at spawn point\n  - `walking` \u2192 moving to workstation with walk animation\n  - `arriving` \u2192 reaching workstation with hop animation\n  - `working` \u2192 at workstation doing tool-specific work\n  - `idle` \u2192 at workstation but not actively working\n- **Movement System**: \n  - Position interpolation from spawn to workstation using lerp\n  - Smooth rotation towards movement direction (5x damping)\n  - Walk speed: 2 units per second\n  - `updateWalkingAgents(delta)` function handles all movement logic\n\n### 3. Visual Polish\n- **Walk Dust Particles**: 8-particle system that spawns at character's feet while walking\n  - Particles have lifetime tracking and fade/reset after 0.5 seconds\n  - Visible only during walking state\n  - Brown dust color (0xD2B48C)\n- **Smooth Rotation**: Characters face direction of movement with normalized angle interpolation\n- **Arrival Animation**: Brief hop (0.2 units high) when reaching workstation using setInterval\n- **State-Aware Animations**: Work animations only play when not walking/spawning\n\n### 4.

Walking Animation (animalModels.ts)\n- Added `walkMotion(delta)` method to AnimalModel class\n- Implemented alternating leg movement using sinusoidal functions\n- Added body bobbing motion (0.08 units) synchronized with footsteps\n- Implemented arm swinging opposite to leg movement\n- Added forward-leaning posture (0.1 radians) and slight side-to-side sway\n- Head stays relatively level with slight downward tilt to look forward\n\n### 2. Spawn & Walk System (GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue)\n- **Spawn Points**: Characters now spawn either at center (0, 0.3, 0) or random edge positions (radius 12)\n- **State Machine**: Added 5 states to agent tracking:\n  - `spawning` \u2192 character appears at spawn point\n  - `walking` \u2192 moving to workstation with walk animation\n  - `arriving` \u2192 reaching workstation with hop animation\n  - `working` \u2192 at workstation doing tool-specific work\n  - `idle` \u2192 at workstation but not actively working\n- **Movement System**: \n  - Position interpolation from spawn to workstation using lerp\n  - Smooth rotation towards movement direction (5x damping)\n  - Walk speed: 2 units per second\n  - `updateWalkingAgents(delta)` function handles all movement logic\n\n### 3. Visual Polish\n- **Walk Dust Particles**: 8-particle system that spawns at character's feet while walking\n  - Particles have lifetime tracking and fade/reset after 0.5 seconds\n  - Visible only during walking state\n  - Brown dust color (0xD2B48C)\n- **Smooth Rotation**: Characters face direction of movement with normalized angle interpolation\n- **Arrival Animation**: Brief hop (0.2 units high) when reaching workstation using setInterval\n- **State-Aware Animations**: Work animations only play when not walking/spawning\n\n### 4.

Walking Animation (animalModels.ts)\n- Added `walkMotion(delta)` method to AnimalModel class\n- Implemented alternating leg movement using sinusoidal functions\n- Added body bobbing motion (0.08 units) synchronized with footsteps\n- Implemented arm swinging opposite to leg movement\n- Added forward-leaning posture (0.1 radians) and slight side-to-side sway\n- Head stays relatively level with slight downward tilt to look forward\n\n### 2. Spawn & Walk System (GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue)\n- **Spawn Points**: Characters now spawn either at center (0, 0.3, 0) or random edge positions (radius 12)\n- **State Machine**: Added 5 states to agent tracking:\n  - `spawning` \u2192 character appears at spawn point\n  - `walking` \u2192 moving to workstation with walk animation\n  - `arriving` \u2192 reaching workstation with hop animation\n  - `working` \u2192 at workstation doing tool-specific work\n  - `idle` \u2192 at workstation but not actively working\n- **Movement System**: \n  - Position interpolation from spawn to workstation using lerp\n  - Smooth rotation towards movement direction (5x damping)\n  - Walk speed: 2 units per second\n  - `updateWalkingAgents(delta)` function handles all movement logic\n\n### 3. Visual Polish\n- **Walk Dust Particles**: 8-particle system that spawns at character's feet while walking\n  - Particles have lifetime tracking and fade/reset after 0.5 seconds\n  - Visible only during walking state\n  - Brown dust color (0xD2B48C)\n- **Smooth Rotation**: Characters face direction of movement with normalized angle interpolation\n- **Arrival Animation**: Brief hop (0.2 units high) when reaching workstation using setInterval\n- **State-Aware Animations**: Work animations only play when not walking/spawning\n\n### 4.

Now I have enough information to create a comprehensive research report. Let me compile my findings.\n\n## Research Report: Three.js Character Animations and Walking Mechanics\n\n### Key Findings\n- Custom character animation system built on Three.js with bipedal humanoid animal models\n- Smooth movement interpolation using `lerpVectors` for position and delta-time-based rotation smoothing\n- Multi-state animation system (idle, walking, typing, hammering, reading, writing, using)\n- Walking mechanics with alternating limb movement, body bob, and dust particle effects\n- Delta-time-based animation for frame-rate independence\n\n### Files Analyzed\n- `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/components/GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue` (main 3D scene orchestration)\n- `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/utils/animalModels.ts` (character models and animation logic)\n- `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/components/GameWorld3D.vue` (base scene setup)\n\n### Architecture/Patterns\n\n**Character Model Architecture**:\n- Base `AnimalModel` class extending `THREE.Group` with hierarchical skeleton structure\n- Body parts: torso, head group, left/right arms with elbows, left/right legs, hands/feet\n- Each animal (12 types: owl, beaver, rabbit, dragon, fox, penguin, bear, cat, pig, turtle, squirrel, koala) inherits from base class\n- Tool holder system for holding objects in hands during animations\n\n**Animation State Machine**:\n```typescript\nstate: 'spawning' | 'walking' | 'arriving' | 'working' | 'idle'\ncurrentAnimation: 'idle' | 'typing' | 'hammering' | 'reading' | 'writing' | 'using'\n```\n\n**Walking System Components**:\n1. Position interpolation using `lerpVectors`\n2. Smooth rotation with angle normalization\n3. Limb animation (alternating legs/arms)\n4. Body bob and sway\n5. Dust particle effects\n6. Arrival animation (hop)\n\n### Best Practices for Smooth Movement Interpolation\n\n**1. Delta-Time-Based Movement** (Line 845-923 in GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue):\n```typescript\nconst WALK_SPEED = 2.0; // units per second\nconst delta = (time - lastTime) / 1000; // Convert to seconds\n\n// Interpolate position based on delta time\ndata.position.lerpVectors(\n  data.position,\n  data.targetPosition,\n  WALK_SPEED * delta / distance\n);\n```\n- Uses delta time to ensure consistent movement speed across different frame rates\n- `lerpVectors` provides smooth linear interpolation between current and target positions\n- Movement speed normalized by distance to prevent overshooting\n\n**2. Smooth Rotation with Angle Normalization** (Lines 875-884):\n```typescript\nconst targetRotation = Math.atan2(direction.x, direction.z);\nconst currentRotation = data.animal.rotation.y;\nconst rotationDiff = targetRotation - currentRotation;\n\n// Normalize angle difference to -PI to PI (prevents 360\u00b0 spins)\nconst normalizedDiff = Math.atan2(Math.sin(rotationDiff), Math.cos(rotationDiff));\ndata.animal.rotation.y += normalizedDiff * delta * 5;\n```\n- Calculates shortest rotation path using angle normalization\n- Prevents \"spinning through 360 degrees\" when crossing the -\u03c0/\u03c0 boundary\n- Delta-based rotation speed (multiplier of 5 for responsiveness)\n\n**3. Walking Animation Cycle** (Lines 402-436 in animalModels.ts):\n```typescript\nconst walkSpeed = 8.0; // Animation speed multiplier\nconst walkTime = this.animationTime * walkSpeed;\n\n// Alternating leg movement using sine waves\nthis.leftLeg.rotation.x = Math.sin(walkTime) * 0.4;\nthis.rightLeg.rotation.x = Math.sin(walkTime + Math.PI) * 0.4; // 180\u00b0 out of phase\n\n// Arms swing opposite to legs (natural walking)\nthis.leftArm.rotation.x = Math.sin(walkTime + Math.PI) * 0.3;\nthis.rightArm.rotation.x = Math.sin(walkTime) * 0.3;\n\n// Body bob (vertical bounce)\nconst bobAmount = 0.08;\nthis.position.y = this.baseY + Math.abs(Math.sin(walkTime * 2)) * bobAmount;\n\n// Side-to-side sway\nthis.rotation.z = Math.sin(walkTime) * 0.05;\n```\n- Sine wave-based limb oscillation for natural walking motion\n- Phase offsets (\u03c0) create alternating left/right movement\n- Double-frequency body bob (`walkTime * 2`) creates two bobs per walk cycle\n- Subtle sway adds realism\n\n**4. OrbitControls Damping** (Lines 235-237):\n```typescript\ncontrols.enableDamping = true;\ncontrols.dampingFactor = 0.05; // Low value for smooth camera movement\n```\n- Damping creates smooth, momentum-based camera controls\n- Low damping factor (0.05) provides gradual deceleration\n\n**5. State Transitions** (Lines 849-920):\n```typescript\n// Spawning \u2192 Walking\nif (data.state === 'spawning') {\n  data.state = 'walking';\n  data.walkProgress = 0;\n  if (data.walkDustParticles) {\n    data.walkDustParticles.visible = true;\n  }\n}\n\n// Walking \u2192 Arriving (with hop animation)\nif (distance <= 0.1) {\n  data.state = 'arriving';\n  // Smooth arrival with interpolated hop\n  const hopY = startY + Math.sin(hopProgress * Math.PI) * hopHeight;\n}\n```\n- Clear state machine prevents animation conflicts\n- Distance threshold (0.1 units) triggers arrival\n- Arrival hop uses sine interpolation for smooth arc\n\n### Insights\n\n**Key Animation Techniques**:\n1. **Sine wave oscillation** - Natural periodic motion for limbs\n2. **Phase offsetting** - Create alternating movements (left/right legs)\n3. **Delta-time normalization** - Frame-rate independent animation\n4. **Linear interpolation (lerp)** - Smooth position transitions\n5. **Angle normalization** - Shortest rotation paths\n6. **Hierarchical transforms** - Parent-child bone structure\n\n**Performance Optimizations**:\n- Animation only runs when agents are in specific states (walking, working)\n- Particle systems toggled based on state (visible during walking only)\n- Delta-time calculation done once per frame and reused\n- `Math.min` and `Math.max` clamps prevent overshooting\n\n**Smoothness Factors**:\n- Walk speed of 2.0 units/second provides natural pace\n- Rotation multiplier of 5 ensures responsive turning without snapping\n- Bob amount of 0.08 creates subtle bounce without excessive motion\n- Limb rotation amplitude of 0.3-0.4 radians (~17-23 degrees) for realistic swing\n\n**Potential Improvements**:\n1. Consider easing functions (ease-in/out) for acceleration/deceleration instead of linear lerp\n2. Add foot IK (Inverse Kinematics) to ensure feet plant properly on ground\n3. Implement animation blending between states for smoother transitions\n4. Add speed-based animation scaling (faster walk = faster limb movement)\n5. Consider quaternion-based rotation for more complex movements\n\n### References\n- Position interpolation: `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/components/GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue:865-870`\n- Rotation smoothing: `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/components/GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue:875-884`\n- Walk cycle animation: `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/utils/animalModels.ts:402-436`\n- AnimalModel class structure: `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/utils/animalModels.ts:23-451`\n- State machine: `/Users/tomkwon/Documents/claude-agentic-framework/apps/observability/client/src/components/GameWorld3DIntegrated.vue:80-81`</result>\n<usage>total_tokens: 68999\ntool_uses: 11\nduration_ms: 73192</usage>\n</task-notification>\nFull transcript available at: /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-tomkwon-Documents/tasks/ae465e2.output",
