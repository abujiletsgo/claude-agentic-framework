# ─── Coordination Strategy ───────────────────────────────────────

coordination:
  strategy: parallel_research_then_debate
  description: Researchers work independently, then debate findings to reach consensus

  phases:
    - phase: independent_research
      agents: [primary-researcher, comparative-researcher, integration-researcher]
      execution: parallel
      timeout: 900  # 15 minutes per researcher

    - phase: findings_debate
      agents: [primary-researcher, comparative-researcher, integration-researcher]
      execution: round_robin  # Each presents, others challenge
      timeout: 600  # 10 minutes

    - phase: consensus
      agent: primary-researcher  # Synthesizes final recommendation
      execution: sequential
      inputs: [all_findings, debate_transcript]
      timeout: 300  # 5 minutes

  conflict_resolution:
    - Primary-researcher has final say on technical accuracy
    - Comparative-researcher arbitrates feature comparison disputes
    - Integration-researcher decides on codebase compatibility questions

# ─── Communication Patterns ──────────────────────────────────────

communication:
  shared_context:
    research_question: Specific question or technology to investigate
    requirements: Must-have features and constraints
    current_stack: Existing technologies for compatibility check
    budget: Licensing costs, training time, migration effort

  handoff_protocol:
    - "primary-researcher writes: primary_research.md"
    - "comparative-researcher writes: comparative_analysis.md"
    - "integration-researcher writes: integration_analysis.md"
    - "consensus phase creates: research_recommendation.md"

  output_location: .claude/research/

  debate_format:
    - Each researcher presents key findings (3 minutes)
    - Others challenge assumptions and ask clarifying questions
    - Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
    - Vote on final recommendation (majority wins)

# ─── Exit Criteria ───────────────────────────────────────────────

exit_criteria:
  success:
    - All researchers complete their analysis
    - Consensus reached on recommendation
    - Action plan defined (adopt, investigate further, reject)

  failure:
    - Timeout exceeded (30 minutes total)
    - Irreconcilable disagreement among researchers
    - Insufficient information available (documentation gap)

  partial_success:
    - Research complete but no clear winner
    - More investigation needed (deferred decision)
