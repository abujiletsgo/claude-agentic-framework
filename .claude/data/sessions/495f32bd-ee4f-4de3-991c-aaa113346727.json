    "1) vault mind is not for global claude knowledge, that is a project specific thing. which is only Obsidian note taking tool\n2) I want you to implment skill direcotry and bring in skills that are known to be good to have, more general skills, i'll build my own as i work on more projects. \n3) implement prompt based instead of command. i want you to create a\u00a0generalist prompt based hooks that would work well on most situations\n4) I actually would love to have a subagent / agent that creates project specific skills and prompts hooks that is located in the project. so when anyone works on it with claude code later on will be able to \"/prime\" and learn and utilize these skills and prompts.

Love tagging.\n7) i thought i had gitworktrees set but if not please set it up\n8) do implement continous background review, use the recommended setup\n9) i would love to have multi-model tier optimization, i thought i did have it set up. but if not please set it up to the best practices\n10) do include knowledge pipelines. would love to implenet this completely. evolving is very important. \n11) do take anthropic's offical docs more seriously and take it to considseration when setting everything up. \n12) for community insights, i like the superpowers, roborev\n13) DO implement all key community patterns that i don't have \n\nUse Opus 4.6 only to get everything set up",
