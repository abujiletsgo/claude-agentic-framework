    "i just did can youremove bash install.sh from the folder",
    "can you test run and see if t works well. i see so many hook errors",
    "just because it's \"working\" doesn't mean it's good. every single line  of code and settings, tools skills have to have an exact purpose and be as efficient as possible. i need you to combthrough everything so this is the most well written configuration for global claude",

    "this is the problem, you are in an infinite loop, that's why i had precautions to stop this from happening.",
    "good",
    "would this memory be transferable as well? wehn someone uninstalls and installs the new claude config?",
    "but some needs to be transferred like the on you learned. the inifite looping will happen to others as well. we should fix that in the fundamental level. also can you make sure there is no single line of md file or code that doesn't have a purpose and errors when ran?"
